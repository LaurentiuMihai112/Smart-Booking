## About

## API Endpoints
In order to access user data, the client must log in first and for every request it should have an "Authorization" header, with the value containing the token.

For example, the header could be "`Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9`" if the token received from logging in is "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9".

The api documentation can be found below.
